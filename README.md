# MOIA Full Stack Coding Challenge

MOIA Coding Challenge for Full Stack applicants - a react and nodejs project that needs some love &lt;3

## Welcome

Dear applicant,

we're glad you want to be part of our team and take the time to show your skills in this challenge. =)

Instead of letting you build an app from scratch we want to give you a more realistic setting. It's more likely that in your real worklife you need to take over the work of someone else, make it more stable, future ready, own it and add features.

This is what we want you to do now. We prepared a react and nodejs project for you that needs some love: apparently the codeowners who left this legacy code base to you were in a rush and didn't manage to leave it in a clean and stable state. Maybe they even didn't have the expertise that you have.

Please take about 4 hours to get familiar with this project, find the flaws that YOU think are most important to fix first, add tools that help you to professionalize it, maybe even add a feature you're missing and tell us about your thought process in REASONING.md. Please commit all your work to a new branch and open a Pull Request in the end.

You won't be DONE after these 4 hours and that's expected. In our job as developers we're never done, right? ;-)

We're curious to see what you focus on. There is no right or wrong - we just want to understand what expertise you will bring to the team! \m/
