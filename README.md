# MOIA Full Stack Coding Challenge

MOIA Coding Challenge for Full Stack applicants - a react and nodejs project that needs some love &lt;3

## Welcome

Dear applicant,

we're glad you want to be part of our team and take the time to show your skills in this challenge. =)

Instead of letting you build an app from scratch we want to give you a more realistic setting. It's more likely that in your real worklife you need to take over the work of someone else, make it more stable, future ready, own it and add features.

This is what we want you to do now. We prepared a react and nodejs project for you that needs some love: apparently the codeowners who left this legacy code base to you were in a rush and didn't manage to leave it in a clean and stable state. Maybe they even didn't have the expertise that you have.

## Getting started

Run the backend with `cd backend && npm install && npm start` - [see backend/README.md](backend/README.md)
